# AlgorithmsAndDataStructures
This is a folder where that I will use as a container for files containing data structures and algorithms. The purpose is to be used by myself as a reference for other, more complex projects. Another purpose is to demonstrate my skills as a propgrammer when it comes to these two highly important topics in computer science.

### Finite State Machine Symbol Tokenizer

>A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.[1] An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two typesâ€”deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines.[2] A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.

This finite state machine is designed to parse tokens from a programming language, as part of the design of a compiler. In other words, this file is one used to create a compiler.

Upon request I can share a private repository of a Finite State Machine Tokenizer, or FSM Tokenizer. I cannot display it in this repository because this repository is public and the FSM Tokenizer that I made was my solution to my final project in my college class Algorithms. Because of that, the professor asked us to *not* publically share the code, to prevent plagiarism from other or future students. However, that was my final project for the class and I would like to show it off because I worked really hard on it, so if you are interested please contact me!

### Fibonacci Sequence
fibo(n) returns the fibonacci sequence of an integer, n.

The following are test cases of fibo(n):

> fibo(0) == 0
>
> fibo(1) == 1
>
> fibo(2) == 1
>
> fibo(3) == 2
>
> fibo(4) == 3
>
> fibo(5) == 5
>
> fibo(10) == 55
